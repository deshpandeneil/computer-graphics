This repository contains my solutions to the CGL assignments mentioned in the SPPU curriculum of B.E. IT (2019 Pattern) along with a few more supplementary pieces of code. 

### Assignment 1
Install and explore the OpenGL.

### Assignment 2
Implement DDA and Bresenham line drawing algorithm to draw: 
1. Simple Line 
2. Dotted Line 
3. Dashed Line 
4. Solid line

Using mouse interface Divide the screen in four quadrants with center as (0, 0). The line should work for all the slopes positive as well as negative.

### Assignment 3
Implement Bresenham circle drawing algorithm to draw any object. The object should be displayed in all the quadrants with respect to center and radius.

### Assignment 4
Implement the following polygon filling methods:
1. Flood fill / Seed fill
2. Boundary fill

Using mouse click, keyboard interface and menu driven programming.

### Assignment 5
Implement Cohen Sutherland polygon clipping method to clip the polygon with respect the viewport and window. Use mouse click, keyboard interface.

### Assignment 6
Implement following 2D transformations on the object with respect to axis:
1. Scaling
2. Rotation about arbitrary point
3. Reflection

### Assignment 7
Generate fractal patterns using:
1. Bezier
2. Koch Curve

### Assignment 8
Implement animation principles for any object.
